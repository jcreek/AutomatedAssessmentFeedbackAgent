# Potential Tool Ideas for Agentic AI in Automated Assessment

This document is a brainstorming location for all the tool concepts that my agentic AI could use to support assessment, feedback, and differentiated instruction across subjects, academic levels, and pedagogical approaches. My goal is to inspire extensibility and versatility for teachers in a wide variety of educational contexts.

## 1. Assessment Tools by Subject & Academic Level

### STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math)

- **Code Runner & Tester**: Execute and evaluate code submissions in multiple languages.
- **Math Expression Evaluator**: Parse and check mathematical expressions for correctness.
- **Automated Proof Checker**: Assess logic proofs, derivations, or stepwise math solutions.
- **Simulation Validator**: Run and check science/engineering simulations against expected results.
- **Data Analysis Checker**: Validate student work with datasets (e.g., statistics, spreadsheets).
- **Unit Converter**: Check for correct use of units and conversions in STEM problems.

### Humanities & Social Sciences

- **Essay Analyzer**: Evaluate structure, argumentation, and evidence in essays.
- **Plagiarism Detector**: Check for originality in written work.
- **Citation Checker**: Validate citation formats (APA, MLA, etc.).
- **Source Quality Assessor**: Analyze the quality and relevance of sources used.
- **Language Complexity Analyzer**: Assess vocabulary and syntax for grade-level appropriateness.

### Creative Subjects

- **Artwork Critique Tool**: Provide feedback on digital art submissions (composition, technique, etc.).
- **Music Theory Checker**: Analyze compositions for theory and notation accuracy.
- **Performance Feedback Tool**: Use video/audio analysis to assess presentations or performances.

### All Subjects

- **Rubric Matcher**: Automatically match submissions to custom rubrics.
- **Peer Review Facilitator**: Organize and anonymize peer feedback rounds.
- **Self-Assessment Prompter**: Guide students through self-reflection on their work.
- **Automated Grading Tool**: Assign grades based on criteria and evidence.
- **Misconception Detector**: Identify common errors or misconceptions in student responses.

## 2. Pedagogical & Differentiation Tools

- **Bloom’s Taxonomy Classifier**: Categorize student responses by cognitive level (recall, analysis, synthesis, etc.).
- **Learning Style Adapter**: Suggest feedback or resources tailored to visual, auditory, or kinesthetic learners.
- **Growth Mindset Feedback Generator**: Frame feedback to encourage resilience and improvement.
- **Formative Assessment Generator**: Create quick quizzes or checks for understanding based on student work.
- **Adaptive Hint Generator**: Offer scaffolded hints that increase in specificity as needed.
- **Progress Tracker**: Maintain a profile of each student’s strengths, weaknesses, and growth over time.
- **IEP/504 Plan Aligner**: Ensure assessments and feedback are accessible and aligned with accommodations.

## 3. Resource & Scaffolding Tools

- **Personalized Resource Recommender**: Suggest readings, videos, or exercises based on student needs.
- **Extension Activity Generator**: Create enrichment tasks for advanced students.
- **Remediation Pathway Designer**: Build step-by-step plans for students needing extra help.
- **Concept Map Builder**: Generate visual maps linking concepts in student work.
- **Practice Problem Generator**: Create new, targeted practice problems.
- **FAQ Generator**: Anticipate and answer common student questions based on submissions.

## 4. Tool Combinations & Orchestration Ideas

- **Rubric Matcher + Feedback Generator**: Provide targeted, actionable feedback aligned to specific criteria.
- **Plagiarism Detector + Citation Checker**: Ensure originality and proper attribution in essays.
- **Code Runner + Misconception Detector**: Identify logic errors and provide corrective feedback in programming.
- **Essay Analyzer + Bloom’s Classifier**: Assess depth of reasoning and suggest next steps.
- **Peer Review + Growth Mindset Feedback**: Facilitate peer-to-peer learning with constructive framing.
- **Progress Tracker + Personalized Resource Recommender**: Continuously adapt resources as students grow.
- **Self-Assessment + Adaptive Hint Generator**: Encourage metacognition and scaffolded learning.
- **Performance Feedback + Extension Activity**: Support creative growth with tailored challenges.

## 5. Out-of-the-Box & Future-Facing Ideas

- **AI Debate Coach**: Simulate debate rounds and provide feedback on rhetoric and evidence.
- **Ethics Checker**: Analyze written or project work for ethical considerations.
- **Collaboration Analyzer**: Assess group project contributions and teamwork dynamics.
- **Emotion Recognition in Feedback**: Tailor responses based on detected student affect (from text, audio, or video).
- **Real-Time Classroom Dashboard**: Aggregate and visualize ongoing assessment data for teachers.
- **Parent/Guardian Communication Tool**: Summarize progress and next steps for families.
- **Multilingual Feedback Generator**: Provide feedback in the student’s preferred language.

## 6. Customization & Extensibility

- All tools should be modular and configurable for different subjects, grade levels, and pedagogical goals.
- Allow teachers to combine tools in custom workflows (e.g., rubric check + peer review + resource recommendation).
- Support easy addition of new tools as education evolves.
